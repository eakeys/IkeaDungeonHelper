# Ikea Dungeon Helper
An assortment of features to assist in DLC dungeons in ESO. I'm adding things gradually as I find uses for them, but some things I'm already planning to do and just haven't gotten around to yet

## Installation instructions
I'm not planning to put this on Minion/EsoUI anytime soon, not least because Ikea is a trademarked name :p so you'll have to download and update it manually. Click 'Code' -> 'Download ZIP' at the top right of this page, then go to your addons folder (probably Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns/), create a folder called "IkeaDungeonHelper" **(make sure you spell it this way, or it will not work!)** and unzip the contents into that folder.

Notably if you download as a ZIP the folder may be called something like IkeaDungeonHelper-main. **You must change this back** to IkeaDungeonHelper!

## Changelog 
* v1.1: Partial support for Coral Aerie: Varallion wave timers & alerts (normal and HM only, HM not tested).
* v1.0: Support for Venomous Evasion in Cradle of Shadows, and Rupture lines in Black Gem Foundry
